# React Basics – Components, Functions & Props

This project is part of my React learning journey.  
Here, I practiced the core concepts of React including:

---

## 🚀 What I Learned

### 🔹 1. React Components
- Created **functional components**
- Understood how components help in splitting UI into reusable parts
- Practiced exporting and importing components

### 🔹 2. Functions inside Components
- Wrote functions to handle logic inside components
- Called these functions from JSX
- Understood how re-rendering happens when state changes (basic intro)

### 🔹 3. Props (Properties)
- Learned how to **send data from parent to child**
- Passed multiple props like:
  - Text
  - Numbers
  - Functions
  - Custom messages

### 🔹 4. Receiving Props in Child Component
- Accessed props using the component parameter
- Displayed props dynamically in JSX
- Understood the concept:  
  **Parent → Child = One-way data flow**
